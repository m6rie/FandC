          <h1 id="part-one">Who am I?</h1>
          <p>Hi there! My name is Marie-Fran√ßoise, or just Marie. I grew up in France in what is called <i>la banlieue parisienne</i> which is the outskirt of Paris. As a youngin, I really liked studying Math and English, that is the reason why I chose these two subjects as my major for the <i>baccalaur√©at</i>.</p>
          <p>I was also very fond of PE. I was quite good at Basketball and Climbing, but I was not so good or interested in long distance running. Regarding the arts, I enjoyed Theatre classes and I practiced several dancing styles over the years: mojern jazz, hip hop, ball dance, dancehall.</p>
          <p>After graduating high school, I moved out to Orl√©ans to study languages. I have learned - and forget - plenty: English, Spanish, Japanese, Turkish, German. I spent an Erasmus year studying at the <i>Universidad de C√≥rdoba</i> in Spain and obtained my BA in English in 2016.</p>
          <p>I then moved to the north of France for my masters of <i>Langues et Technologies</i> (Languages and Technologies). As a final project in the three languages we were studying (English, Spanish, and Dutch), we had to translate a 20 page document in each language. For the technology part, we had to create a website from start to finish with Dreamweaver. This is when I wrote my first lines of code and became interested in coding.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part-two">
          <h1>How did I get here?</h1>
          <p>The reason I moved to London was because I had find an internship there as a Research Assistant. I eventually stayed at that company and got promoted to Research Manager. I was using Excel and SugarCRM a lot. Using exciting technology tools kept me curious even if it was not programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part-three">
          <h1>Why coding?</h1>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, my first enconter with code was during my masters and I really enjoyed it. Given the chance, I would have probably pushed futher in that direction.</p>
          <p>Fastfoward to 2021, I am still exploring Excel and SugarCRM to find ways to do my work faster but it was not as exciting as it used to be. I know that it is time for a change but I am not sure what kind of change.</p>
          <p>Eventually, I started doing some research on 'how to learn how to code', the different programming languages, and which one to start with. I decided to stick with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>. I went through the Fondations, which took me several weeks, but at the end, I knew this was what I wanted to do. I was aware that I needed to be able to give it my own and not just my evenings after work and my weekends if I wanted to make quick progress. I also needed somebody who would know about it more than me. That is the reason why I decided to quit my job. I took a leap of faith because I wanted to turn my hobby into a full-time job and I signed-up for a full-time coding bootcamp.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="part-four">
          <h1>Why Founders and Coders apprenticeship?</h1>
          <p>After completing my bootcamp, I was not feeling confident enough to apply to jobs so I decided to do some more studying. One thing I learned from that is: I will never know everything that is when it comes to programming. Nobody does. Something extremely valuable though is having someone who knows what is important to know and share that knowledge with you. This is how I view apprenticeship. It is the opportunity to keep learning, be trained, and helped to thrive. That is why I want to do an apprenticeship.</p>

          <p>The reason I am applying to Founders and Coders for an apprenticeship is because after doing some research, I have read a lot of very good feedback from people who really enjoyed their learning experience there. Having done something similar with my bootcamp, I know how beneficial it is to study with people from different background and to be able to all learn from each other.</p>
          <p>Seeing the level of preparation F&C wants us to deliver before being considered lead me to believe I could only come out of the programme stronger, even if I do not get an apprenticeship at the end.</p>

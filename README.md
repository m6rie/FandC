# Founders and Coders

This project is several projects in one. They were all made without use of any external libraries and each of them are completely responsive.

## Gallery Project

Once you enter, you can see the Gallery Project where I gathered all the projects under collapsible and clickable cards.

## Hobby Project:

It is a simple webpage with a little bit of CSS animation (spinning snowflake) and JS (date and interactive question at the end)

## Comment Form Project

It has several JS features. The user can:

- Leave a comment limited to 140 characters, their name, and email address.
- All fields are mandatory and if one is missing or the comment is over 140 characters, they cannot submit it.
- Each character is added or removed from the 140 character counter as the user type
- the text zone turns red if the number of character is over 140.
- After submitting the comment, it is displayed on the screen and saved on localStorage

## Movie Data Project

The user can sort a list of movies.

## Website

This final project is the culmination of the previous projects. It includes:

- transition page with animation
- side menu with clickable links to navigate the page faster
